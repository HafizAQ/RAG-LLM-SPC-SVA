It contains the following sections: - About the AXI protocol on page A1-22 - AXI revisions on page A1-23 - AXI Architecture on page A1-24 - Terminology on page A1-27 . ----- A1.1 About the AXI protocol The AMBA AXI protocol supports high-performance, high-frequency system designs. The AXI protocol: - is suitable for high-bandwidth and low-latency designs - provides high-frequency operation without using complex bridges - meets the interface requirements of a wide range of components - is suitable for memory controllers with high initial access latency - provides flexibility in the implementation of interconnect architectures - is backward-compatible with existing AHB and APB interfaces. The key features of the AXI protocol are: - separate addresscontrol and data phases - support for unaligned data transfers, using byte strobes - uses burst-based transactions with only the start address issued - separate read and write data channels, that can provide low-cost Direct Memory Access (DMA) - support for issuing multiple outstanding addresses - support for out-of-order transaction completion - permits easy addition of register stages to provide timing closure. The AXI protocol includes the optional extensions that cover signaling for low-power operation. The AXI protocol includes the AXI4-Lite specification, a subset of AXI4 for communication with simpler control register style interfaces within components. See Chapter B1 AMBA AXI4-Lite . ----- A1.2 AXI revisions Earlier issues of this document describe earlier versions of the AMBA AXI Protocol Specification. In particular, Issue B of the document describes the version that is now called AXI3. Issue C adds the definition of an extended version of the protocol called AXI4 and a new interface, AXI4-Lite, that provides a simpler control register interface, for applications that do not require the full functionality of AXI4. Issue D integrates the definitions of AXI3 and AXI4 which were presented separately in Issue C. Issue E adds clarifications, recommendations, and specifies new capabilities. To maintain compatibility, a property is used to declare a new capability. If a property is not declared, it is considered False. Table A1-1 summarizes the new properties and the default value that applies for a component that does not have a declared value. Table A1-1 Properties that specify system capability Property Description Default OrderedWriteObservation Improved support for the ProducerConsumer ordering model. See Ordered write observation on page A6-91 False MultiCopyAtomicity Support for multi-copy atomicity. See Multi-copy write atomicity on page A7-95 False Note Some previous issues of this document included a version number in the title. That version number does not refer to the version of the AXI protocol. ----- A1.3 AXI Architecture The AXI protocol is burst-based and defines the following independent transaction channels: - read address - read data - write address - write data - write response. An address channel carries control information that describes the nature of the data to be transferred. The data is transferred between master and slave using either: - A write data channel to transfer data from the master to the slave. In a write transaction, the slave uses the write response channel to signal the completion of the transfer to the master. - A read data channel to transfer data from the slave to the master. The AXI protocol: - permits address information to be issued ahead of the actual data transfer - supports multiple outstanding transactions - supports out-of-order completion of transactions. Figure A1-1 shows how a read transaction uses the read address and read data channels. Master interfaceRead address channelCol3Col4Col5Col6Col7Slave interface ------------------------ Address and control Read data channel Read dataRead dataRead dataRead data Figure A1-1 Channel architecture of reads Figure A1-2 shows how a write transaction uses the write address, write data, and write response channels. Master interfaceWrite address channelCol3Col4Col5Col6Col7Slave interface ------------------------ Address and control Write data channel Write dataWrite dataWrite dataWrite data Write response channel Write response Figure A1-2 Channel architecture of writes ----- A1.3.1 Channel definition Each of the independent channels consists of a set of information signals and VALID and READY signals that provide a two-way handshake mechanism. See Basic read and write transactions on page A3-39 . The information source uses the VALID signal to show when valid address, data or control information is available on the channel. The destination uses the READY signal to show when it can accept the information. Both the read data channel and the write data channel also include a LAST signal to indicate the transfer of the final data item in a transaction. Read and write address channels Read and write transactions each have their own address channel. The appropriate address channel carries all of the required address and control information for a transaction. Read data channel The read data channel carries both the read data and the read response information from the slave to the master, and includes: - the data bus, that can be 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024 bits wide - a read response signal indicating the completion status of the read transaction. Write data channel The write data channel carries the write data from the master to the slave and includes: - the data bus, that can be 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024 bits wide - a byte lane strobe signal for every eight data bits, indicating which bytes of the data are valid. Write data channel information is always treated as buffered, so that the master can perform write transactions without slave acknowledgement of previous write transactions. Write response channel A slave uses the write response channel to respond to write transactions. All write transactions require completion signaling on the write response channel. As Figure A1-2 on page A1-24 shows, completion is signaled only for a complete transaction, not for each data transfer in a transaction. A1.3.2 Interface and interconnect A typical system consists of a number of master and slave devices connected together through some form of interconnect, as Figure A1-3 shows. Figure A1-3 Interface and interconnect The AXI protocol provides a single interface definition, for the interfaces: - between a master and the interconnect - between a slave and the interconnect - between a master and a slave. This interface definition supports a variety of different interconnect implementations. ----- Note An interconnect between devices is equivalent to another device with symmetrical master and slave ports to which real master and slave devices can be connected. Typical system topologies Most systems use one of three interconnect topologies: - shared address and data buses - shared address buses and multiple data buses - multilayer, with multiple address and data buses. In most systems, the address channel bandwidth requirement is significantly less than the data channel bandwidth requirement. Such systems can achieve a good balance between system performance and interconnect complexity by using a shared address bus with multiple data buses to enable parallel data transfers. A1.3.3 Register slices Each AXI channel transfers information in only one direction, and the architecture does not require any fixed relationship between the channels. This means a register slice can be inserted at almost any point in any channel, at the cost of an additional cycle of latency. Note This makes possible: - a trade-off between cycles of latency and maximum frequency of operation - a direct, fast connection between a processor and high performance memory, but to use simple register slices to isolate a longer path to less performance critical peripherals. ----- A1.4 Terminology This section summarizes terms that are used in this specification, and are defined in the Glossary, or elsewhere. Where appropriate, terms listed in this section link to the corresponding glossary definition. A1.4.1 AXI components and topology The following terms describe AXI components: - Component . - Master component . - Slave component . Slave components include Memory slave component s and Peripheral slave component s. - Interconnect component . For a particular AXI transaction, Upstream and Downstream refer to the relative positions of AXI components within the AXI topology. A1.4.2 AXI transactions, and memory types When an AXI master initiates an AXI operation, targeting an AXI slave: - the complete set of required operations on the AXI bus form the AXI Transaction - any required payload data is transferred as an AXI Burst - a burst can comprise multiple data transfers, or AXI Beat s. A1.4.3 Caches and cache operation This specification does not define standard cache terminology, that is defined in any reference work on caching. However, the glossary entries for Cache and Cache line clarify how these terms are used in this document. A1.4.4 Temporal description The AXI specification uses the term In a timely manner . ----- ----- Chapter A2 Signal Descriptions This chapter introduces the AXI interface signals. Most of the signals are required for both AXI3 and AXI4 implementations of the protocol, and the tables summarizing the signals identify the exceptions.

See Peripheral clock required on page A9-107 . ----- Part B AMBA AXI4-Lite Interface Specification ----- ----- Chapter B1 AMBA AXI4-Lite This chapter defines the AXI4-Lite interface and associated protocol. AXI4-Lite is suitable for simpler control register-style interfaces that do not require the full functionality of AXI4. This chapter contains the following sections: - Definition of AXI4-Lite on page B1-126 - Interoperability on page B1-128 - Defined conversion mechanism on page B1-129 - Conversion, protection, and detection on page B1-131 . ----- B1.1 Definition of AXI4-Lite This section defines the functionality and signal requirements of AXI4-Lite components. The key functionality of AXI4-Lite operation is: - all transactions are of burst length 1 - all data accesses use the full width of the data bus AXI4-Lite supports a data bus width of 32-bit or 64-bit. - all accesses are Non-modifiable, Non-bufferable - Exclusive accesses are not supported. B1.1.1 Signal list Table B1-1 shows the required signals on an AXI4-Lite interface. Table B1-1 AXI4-Lite interface signals Write address Write data Write response Read address Read data Global channel channel channel channel channel ACLK AWVALID WVALID BVALID ARVALID RVALID ARESETn AWREADY WREADY BREADY ARREADY RREADY AWADDR WDATA BRESP ARADDR RDATA AWPROT WSTRB ARPROT RRESP AXI4 signals modified in AXI4-Lite The AXI4-Lite interface does not fully support the following signals: RRESP, BRESP The EXOKAY response is not supported on the read data and write response channels. AXI4 signals not supported in AXI4-Lite The AXI4-Lite interface does not support the following signals: AWLEN, ARLEN The burst length is defined to be 1, equivalent to an AxLEN value of zero. AWSIZE, ARSIZE All accesses are defined to be the width of the data bus. Note AXI4-Lite requires a fixed data bus width of either 32-bit or 64-bit. AWBURST, ARBURST The burst type has no meaning because the burst length is 1. AWLOCK, ARLOCK All accesses are defined as Normal accesses, equivalent to an AxLOCK value of zero. AWCACHE, ARCACHE All accesses are defined as Non-modifiable, Non-bufferable, equivalent to an AxCACHE value of 0b0000 . ----- WLAST, RLAST All bursts are defined to be of length 1, equivalent to a WLAST or RLAST value of 1. B1.1.2 Bus width AXI4-Lite has a fixed data bus width and all transactions are the same width as the data bus. The data bus width must be, either 32-bits or 64-bits. ARM expects that: - the majority of components use a 32-bit interface - only components requiring 64-bit atomic accesses use a 64-bit interface. A 64-bit component can be designed for access by 32-bit masters, but the implementation must ensure that the component sees all transactions as 64-bit transactions. Note This interoperability can be achieved by including, in the register map of the component, locations that are suitable for access by a 32-bit master. Typically, such locations would use only the lower 32-bits of the data bus. B1.1.3 Write strobes The AXI4-Lite protocol supports write strobes. This means multi-sized registers can be implemented and also supports memory structures that require support for 8-bit and 16-bit accesses. All master interfaces and interconnect components must provide correct write strobes. Any slave component can choose whether to use the write strobes. The options permitted are: - to make full use of the write strobes - to ignore the write strobes and treat all write accesses as being the full data bus width - to detect write strobe combinations that are not supported and provide an error response. A slave that provides memory access must fully support write strobes. Other slaves in the memory map might support a more limited write strobe option. When converting from full AXI to AXI4-Lite, a write transaction can be generated on AXI4-Lite with all write strobes deasserted. Automatic suppression of such transactions is permitted but not required. See Conversion, protection, and detection on page B1-131 . B1.1.4 Optional signaling AXI4-Lite supports multiple outstanding transactions, but a slave can restrict this by the appropriate use of the handshake signals. AXI4-Lite does not support AXI IDs. This means all transactions must be in order, and all accesses use a single fixed ID value. Note Optionally, an AXI4-Lite slave can support AXI ID signals, so that it can be connected to a full AXI interface without modification. See Interoperability on page B1-128 . AXI4-Lite does not support data interleaving, the burst length is defined as 1. ----- B1.2 Interoperability This section describes the interoperability of AXI and AXI4-Lite masters and slaves. Table B1-2 shows the possible combinations of interface, and indicates that the only case requiring special consideration is an AXI master connecting to an AXI4-Lite slave. Table B1-2 Full AXI and AXI4-Lite interoperability Master Slave Interoperability AXI AXI Fully operational. AXI AXI4-Lite AXI ID reflection is required. Conversion might be required. AXI4-Lite AXI Fully operational. AXI4-Lite AXI4-Lite Fully operational. B1.2.1 Bridge requirements of AXI4-Lite slaves As Table B1-2 shows, the only interoperability case that requires special consideration is the connection of an AXI4-Lite slave interface to a full AXI master interface. This connection requires AXI ID reflection. The AXI4-Lite slave must return the AXI ID associated with the address of a transaction with the read data or write response for that transaction. This is required because the master requires the returning ID to correctly identify the transaction response. If an implementation cannot ensure that the AXI master interface only generates transactions in the AXI4-Lite subset, then some form of adaptation is required. See Conversion, protection, and detection on page B1-131 . B1.2.2 Direct connection requirements of AXI4-Lite slaves An AXI4-Lite slave can be designed to include ID reflection logic. This means the slave can be used directly on a full AXI connection, without a bridge function, in a system that guarantees that the slave is accessed only by transactions that comply with the AXI4-Lite subset. Note This specification recommends that the ID reflection logic uses AWID, instead of WID, to ensure compatibility with both AXI3 and AXI4. ----- B1.3 Defined conversion mechanism This section defines the requirements to convert any legal AXI transaction for use on an AXI4-Lite component. Conversion, protection, and detection on page B1-131 discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches that can be used. B1.3.1 Conversion rules Conversion requires that the AXI data width is equal to or greater than the AXI4-Lite data width. If this is not the case then the AXI data width must first be converted to the AXI4-Lite data width. Note AXI4-Lite does not support EXOKAY responses, so the conversion rules do not consider this response. The rules for conversion from a full AXI interface are as follows: - If a transaction has a burst length greater than 1 then the burst is broken into multiple transactions of burst length 1. The number of transactions that are created depends on the burst length of the original transaction. - When generating the address for subsequent beats of a burst, the conversion of bursts with a length greater than 1 must take into consideration the burst type. An unaligned start address must be incremented and aligned for subsequent beats of an INCR or WRAP burst. For a FIXED burst the same address is used for all beats. - Where a write burst with length greater than 1 is converted into multiple write transactions, the component responsible for the conversion must combine the responses for all of the generated transactions, to produce a single response for the original burst. Any error response is sticky. That is, an error response received for any of the generated transactions is retained, and the single combined response indicates an error. If both a SLVERR and a DECERR are received then the first response received is the one that is used for the combined response. - A transaction that is wider than the destination AXI4-Lite interface is broken into multiple transactions of the same width as the AXI4-Lite interface. For transactions with an unaligned start address, the breaking up of the burst occurs on boundaries that are aligned to the width of the AXI4-Lite interface. - Where a\\n Relevance Specs from the chunk:\\n 1.

For transactions with an unaligned start address, the breaking up of the burst occurs on boundaries that are aligned to the width of the AXI4-Lite interface. - Where a wide transaction is converted to multiple narrower transactions, the component responsible for the conversion must combine the responses to all of the narrower transactions, to produce a single response for the original transaction. Any error response is sticky. If both a SLVERR and a DECERR are received then the first response received is used for the combined response. - Transactions that are narrower than the AXI4-Lite interface are passed directly and are not converted. - Write strobes are passed directly, unmodified. - Write transactions with no strobes are passed directly. Note The AXI4-Lite protocol does not require these transactions to be suppressed. - The AxLOCK signals are discarded for all transactions. For a sequence of locked transactions any lock guarantee is lost. However, the locked nature of the transaction is lost only at any downstream arbitration. For an exclusive sequence, the AXI signaling requirements mean any exclusive write access must fail. - The AxCACHE signals are discarded. All transactions are treated as Non-modifiable and Non-bufferable. Note This is acceptable because AXI permits Modifiable accesses to be treated as Non-modifiable, and Bufferable accesses to be treated as Non-bufferable. - The AxPROT signals are passed directly, unmodified. ----- The WLAST signal is discarded. The RLAST signal is not required, and is considered asserted for every transfer on the read data channel. ----- B1.4 Conversion, protection, and detection Connection of an AXI4-Lite slave to an AXI4 master requires some form of adaptation if it can not be ensured that the master only issues transactions that meet the AXI4-Lite requirements. This section describes techniques that can be adopted in a system design to aid with the interoperability of components and the debugging of system design problems. These techniques are: Conversion This requires the conversion of all transactions to a format that is compatible with the AXI4-Lite requirements. Protection This requires the detection of any non-compliant transaction. The non-compliant transaction is discarded, and an error response is returned to the master that generated the transaction. Detection This requires observing any transaction that falls outside the AXI4-Lite requirements and: - notifying the controlling software of the unexpected access - permitting the access to proceed at the hardware interface level. B1.4.1 Conversion and protection levels Different levels of conversion and protection can be implemented: Full conversion This converts all AXI transactions, as described in Defined conversion mechanism on page B1-129 . Simple conversion with protection This propagates transactions that only require a simple conversion, but suppresses and error reports transactions that require a more complex task. Examples of transactions that are propagated are the discarding of one or more of AxLOCK and AxCACHE . Examples of transactions that are discarded and generate an error report are burst length or data width conversions. Full protection Suppress and generate an error for every transaction that does not comply with the AXI4-Lite requirements. B1.4.2 Implementation considerations A protection mechanism that discards transactions must provide a protocol-compliant error response to prevent deadlock. For example, in the full AXI protocol, read burst transactions require an error for each beat of the burst and a correctly asserted RLAST signal. Using a combination of detection and conversion permits hardware implementations that: - do not prevent unexpected accesses from occurring - provide a mechanism for notifying the controlling software of the unexpected access, so speeding up the debug process. In complex designs, the advantage of combining conversion and detection is that unforeseen future usage can be supported. For example, at design time it might be considered that only the processor programs the control register of a peripheral, but in practice, the peripheral might need to be programmed by other devices, for example a DSP or a DMA controller, that cannot generate exactly the required AXI4-Lite access. The advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches are: - Protection requires a lower gate count. - Conversion ensures the interface can operate with unforeseen accesses. - Conversion increases the portability of software from one system to another. ----- Conversion might provide more efficient use of the AXI infrastructure. For example, a burst of writes to a FIFO can be issued as a single burst, rather than needing to be issued as a set of single transactions. Conversion might provide more efficient use of narrow links, where the address and data payload signals are shared. Conversion might provide more flexibility in components that can be placed on AXI4-Lite interfaces. By converting bursts and permitting sparse strobes, memory can be placed on AXI4-Lite, with no burst conversion required in the memory device. This is, essentially, a sharing of the burst conversion logic. -----\\n Relevance Specs from the chunk:\\n Updated Specification:\\n\\n1.

For transactions with an unaligned start address, the breaking up of the burst occurs on boundaries that are aligned to the width of the AXI4-Lite interface. - Where a wide transaction is converted to multiple narrower transactions, the component responsible for the conversion must combine the responses to all of the narrower transactions, to produce a single response for the original transaction. Any error response is sticky. If both a SLVERR and a DECERR are received then the first response received is used for the combined response. - Transactions that are narrower than the AXI4-Lite interface are passed directly and are not converted. - Write strobes are passed directly, unmodified. - Write transactions with no strobes are passed directly. Note The AXI4-Lite protocol does not require these transactions to be suppressed. - The AxLOCK signals are discarded for all transactions. For a sequence of locked transactions any lock guarantee is lost. However, the locked nature of the transaction is lost only at any downstream arbitration. For an exclusive sequence, the AXI signaling requirements mean any exclusive write access must fail. - The AxCACHE signals are discarded. All transactions are treated as Non-modifiable and Non-bufferable. Note This is acceptable because AXI permits Modifiable accesses to be treated as Non-modifiable, and Bufferable accesses to be treated as Non-bufferable. - The AxPROT signals are passed directly, unmodified. ----- The WLAST signal is discarded. The RLAST signal is not required, and is considered asserted for every transfer on the read data channel. ----- B1.4 Conversion, protection, and detection Connection of an AXI4-Lite slave to an AXI4 master requires some form of adaptation if it can not be ensured that the master only issues transactions that meet the AXI4-Lite requirements. This section describes techniques that can be adopted in a system design to aid with the interoperability of components and the debugging of system design problems. These techniques are: Conversion This requires the conversion of all transactions to a format that is compatible with the AXI4-Lite requirements. Protection This requires the detection of any non-compliant transaction. The non-compliant transaction is discarded, and an error response is returned to the master that generated the transaction. Detection This requires observing any transaction that falls outside the AXI4-Lite requirements and: - notifying the controlling software of the unexpected access - permitting the access to proceed at the hardware interface level. B1.4.1 Conversion and protection levels Different levels of conversion and protection can be implemented: Full conversion This converts all AXI transactions, as described in Defined conversion mechanism on page B1-129 . Simple conversion with protection This propagates transactions that only require a simple conversion, but suppresses and error reports transactions that require a more complex task. Examples of transactions that are propagated are the discarding of one or more of AxLOCK and AxCACHE . Examples of transactions that are discarded and generate an error report are burst length or data width conversions. Full protection Suppress and generate an error for every transaction that does not comply with the AXI4-Lite requirements. B1.4.2 Implementation considerations A protection mechanism that discards transactions must provide a protocol-compliant error response to prevent deadlock. For example, in the full AXI protocol, read burst transactions require an error for each beat of the burst and a correctly asserted RLAST signal. Using a combination of detection and conversion permits hardware implementations that: - do not prevent unexpected accesses from occurring - provide a mechanism for notifying the controlling software of the unexpected access, so speeding up the debug process. In complex designs, the advantage of combining conversion and detection is that unforeseen future usage can be supported. For example, at design time it might be considered that only the processor programs the control register of a peripheral, but in practice, the peripheral might need to be programmed by other devices, for example a DSP or a DMA controller, that cannot generate exactly the required AXI4-Lite access. The advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches are: - Protection requires a lower gate count. - Conversion ensures the interface can operate with unforeseen accesses. - Conversion increases the portability of software from one system to another. ----- Conversion might provide more efficient use of the AXI infrastructure. For example, a burst of writes to a FIFO can be issued as a single burst, rather than needing to be issued as a set of single transactions. Conversion might provide more efficient use of narrow links, where the address and data payload signals are shared. Conversion might provide more flexibility in components that can be placed on AXI4-Lite interfaces. By converting bursts and permitting sparse strobes, memory can be placed on AXI4-Lite, with no burst conversion required in the memory device. This is, essentially, a sharing of the burst conversion logic. -----\\n Relevance Specs from the chunk:\\n Updated Specification:\\n\\n1.

It contains the following sections: - About the AXI protocol on page A1-22 - AXI revisions on page A1-23 - AXI Architecture on page A1-24 - Terminology on page A1-27 . ----- A1.1 About the AXI protocol The AMBA AXI protocol supports high-performance, high-frequency system designs. The AXI protocol: - is suitable for high-bandwidth and low-latency designs - provides high-frequency operation without using complex bridges - meets the interface requirements of a wide range of components - is suitable for memory controllers with high initial access latency - provides flexibility in the implementation of interconnect architectures - is backward-compatible with existing AHB and APB interfaces. The key features of the AXI protocol are: - separate addresscontrol and data phases - support for unaligned data transfers, using byte strobes - uses burst-based transactions with only the start address issued - separate read and write data channels, that can provide low-cost Direct Memory Access (DMA) - support for issuing multiple outstanding addresses - support for out-of-order transaction completion - permits easy addition of register stages to provide timing closure. The AXI protocol includes the optional extensions that cover signaling for low-power operation. The AXI protocol includes the AXI4-Lite specification, a subset of AXI4 for communication with simpler control register style interfaces within components. See Chapter B1 AMBA AXI4-Lite . ----- A1.2 AXI revisions Earlier issues of this document describe earlier versions of the AMBA AXI Protocol Specification. In particular, Issue B of the document describes the version that is now called AXI3. Issue C adds the definition of an extended version of the protocol called AXI4 and a new interface, AXI4-Lite, that provides a simpler control register interface, for applications that do not require the full functionality of AXI4. Issue D integrates the definitions of AXI3 and AXI4 which were presented separately in Issue C. Issue E adds clarifications, recommendations, and specifies new capabilities. To maintain compatibility, a property is used to declare a new capability. If a property is not declared, it is considered False. Table A1-1 summarizes the new properties and the default value that applies for a component that does not have a declared value. Table A1-1 Properties that specify system capability Property Description Default OrderedWriteObservation Improved support for the ProducerConsumer ordering model. See Ordered write observation on page A6-91 False MultiCopyAtomicity Support for multi-copy atomicity. See Multi-copy write atomicity on page A7-95 False Note Some previous issues of this document included a version number in the title. That version number does not refer to the version of the AXI protocol. ----- A1.3 AXI Architecture The AXI protocol is burst-based and defines the following independent transaction channels: - read address - read data - write address - write data - write response. An address channel carries control information that describes the nature of the data to be transferred. The data is transferred between master and slave using either: - A write data channel to transfer data from the master to the slave. In a write transaction, the slave uses the write response channel to signal the completion of the transfer to the master. - A read data channel to transfer data from the slave to the master. The AXI protocol: - permits address information to be issued ahead of the actual data transfer - supports multiple outstanding transactions - supports out-of-order completion of transactions. Figure A1-1 shows how a read transaction uses the read address and read data channels. Master interfaceRead address channelCol3Col4Col5Col6Col7Slave interface ------------------------ Address and control Read data channel Read dataRead dataRead dataRead data Figure A1-1 Channel architecture of reads Figure A1-2 shows how a write transaction uses the write address, write data, and write response channels. Master interfaceWrite address channelCol3Col4Col5Col6Col7Slave interface ------------------------ Address and control Write data channel Write dataWrite dataWrite dataWrite data Write response channel Write response Figure A1-2 Channel architecture of writes ----- A1.3.1 Channel definition Each of the independent channels consists of a set of information signals and VALID and READY signals that provide a two-way handshake mechanism. See Basic read and write transactions on page A3-39 . The information source uses the VALID signal to show when valid address, data or control information is available on the channel. The destination uses the READY signal to show when it can accept the information. Both the read data channel and the write data channel also include a LAST signal to indicate the transfer of the final data item in a transaction. Read and write address channels Read and write transactions each have their own address channel. The appropriate address channel carries all of the required address and control information for a transaction. Read data channel The read data channel carries both the read data and the read response information from the slave to the master, and includes: - the data bus, that can be 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024 bits wide - a read response signal indicating the completion status of the read transaction. Write data channel The write data channel carries the write data from the master to the slave and includes: - the data bus, that can be 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024 bits wide - a byte lane strobe signal for every eight data bits, indicating which bytes of the data are valid. Write data channel information is always treated as buffered, so that the master can perform write transactions without slave acknowledgement of previous write transactions. Write response channel A slave uses the write response channel to respond to write transactions. All write transactions require completion signaling on the write response channel. As Figure A1-2 on page A1-24 shows, completion is signaled only for a complete transaction, not for each data transfer in a transaction. A1.3.2 Interface and interconnect A typical system consists of a number of master and slave devices connected together through some form of interconnect, as Figure A1-3 shows. Figure A1-3 Interface and interconnect The AXI protocol provides a single interface definition, for the interfaces: - between a master and the interconnect - between a slave and the interconnect - between a master and a slave. This interface definition supports a variety of different interconnect implementations. ----- Note An interconnect between devices is equivalent to another device with symmetrical master and slave ports to which real master and slave devices can be connected. Typical system topologies Most systems use one of three interconnect topologies: - shared address and data buses - shared address buses and multiple data buses - multilayer, with multiple address and data buses. In most systems, the address channel bandwidth requirement is significantly less than the data channel bandwidth requirement. Such systems can achieve a good balance between system performance and interconnect complexity by using a shared address bus with multiple data buses to enable parallel data transfers. A1.3.3 Register slices Each AXI channel transfers information in only one direction, and the architecture does not require any fixed relationship between the channels. This means a register slice can be inserted at almost any point in any channel, at the cost of an additional cycle of latency. Note This makes possible: - a trade-off between cycles of latency and maximum frequency of operation - a direct, fast connection between a processor and high performance memory, but to use simple register slices to isolate a longer path to less performance critical peripherals. ----- A1.4 Terminology This section summarizes terms that are used in this specification, and are defined in the Glossary, or elsewhere. Where appropriate, terms listed in this section link to the corresponding glossary definition. A1.4.1 AXI components and topology The following terms describe AXI components: - Component . - Master component . - Slave component . Slave components include Memory slave component s and Peripheral slave component s. - Interconnect component . For a particular AXI transaction, Upstream and Downstream refer to the relative positions of AXI components within the AXI topology. A1.4.2 AXI transactions, and memory types When an AXI master initiates an AXI operation, targeting an AXI slave: - the complete set of required operations on the AXI bus form the AXI Transaction - any required payload data is transferred as an AXI Burst - a burst can comprise multiple data transfers, or AXI Beat s. A1.4.3 Caches and cache operation This specification does not define standard cache terminology, that is defined in any reference work on caching. However, the glossary entries for Cache and Cache line clarify how these terms are used in this document. A1.4.4 Temporal description The AXI specification uses the term In a timely manner . ----- ----- Chapter A2 Signal Descriptions This chapter introduces the AXI interface signals.

See Peripheral clock required on page A9-107 . ----- Part B AMBA AXI4-Lite Interface Specification ----- ----- Chapter B1 AMBA AXI4-Lite This chapter defines the AXI4-Lite interface and associated protocol. AXI4-Lite is suitable for simpler control register-style interfaces that do not require the full functionality of AXI4. This chapter contains the following sections: - Definition of AXI4-Lite on page B1-126 - Interoperability on page B1-128 - Defined conversion mechanism on page B1-129 - Conversion, protection, and detection on page B1-131 . ----- B1.1 Definition of AXI4-Lite This section defines the functionality and signal requirements of AXI4-Lite components. The key functionality of AXI4-Lite operation is: - all transactions are of burst length 1 - all data accesses use the full width of the data bus AXI4-Lite supports a data bus width of 32-bit or 64-bit. - all accesses are Non-modifiable, Non-bufferable - Exclusive accesses are not supported. B1.1.1 Signal list Table B1-1 shows the required signals on an AXI4-Lite interface. Table B1-1 AXI4-Lite interface signals Write address Write data Write response Read address Read data Global channel channel channel channel channel ACLK AWVALID WVALID BVALID ARVALID RVALID ARESETn AWREADY WREADY BREADY ARREADY RREADY AWADDR WDATA BRESP ARADDR RDATA AWPROT WSTRB ARPROT RRESP AXI4 signals modified in AXI4-Lite The AXI4-Lite interface does not fully support the following signals: RRESP, BRESP The EXOKAY response is not supported on the read data and write response channels. AXI4 signals not supported in AXI4-Lite The AXI4-Lite interface does not support the following signals: AWLEN, ARLEN The burst length is defined to be 1, equivalent to an AxLEN value of zero. AWSIZE, ARSIZE All accesses are defined to be the width of the data bus. Note AXI4-Lite requires a fixed data bus width of either 32-bit or 64-bit. AWBURST, ARBURST The burst type has no meaning because the burst length is 1. AWLOCK, ARLOCK All accesses are defined as Normal accesses, equivalent to an AxLOCK value of zero. AWCACHE, ARCACHE All accesses are defined as Non-modifiable, Non-bufferable, equivalent to an AxCACHE value of 0b0000 . ----- WLAST, RLAST All bursts are defined to be of length 1, equivalent to a WLAST or RLAST value of 1. B1.1.2 Bus width AXI4-Lite has a fixed data bus width and all transactions are the same width as the data bus. The data bus width must be, either 32-bits or 64-bits. ARM expects that: - the majority of components use a 32-bit interface - only components requiring 64-bit atomic accesses use a 64-bit interface. A 64-bit component can be designed for access by 32-bit masters, but the implementation must ensure that the component sees all transactions as 64-bit transactions. Note This interoperability can be achieved by including, in the register map of the component, locations that are suitable for access by a 32-bit master. Typically, such locations would use only the lower 32-bits of the data bus. B1.1.3 Write strobes The AXI4-Lite protocol supports write strobes. This means multi-sized registers can be implemented and also supports memory structures that require support for 8-bit and 16-bit accesses. All master interfaces and interconnect components must provide correct write strobes. Any slave component can choose whether to use the write strobes. The options permitted are: - to make full use of the write strobes - to ignore the write strobes and treat all write accesses as being the full data bus width - to detect write strobe combinations that are not supported and provide an error response. A slave that provides memory access must fully support write strobes. Other slaves in the memory map might support a more limited write strobe option. When converting from full AXI to AXI4-Lite, a write transaction can be generated on AXI4-Lite with all write strobes deasserted. Automatic suppression of such transactions is permitted but not required. See Conversion, protection, and detection on page B1-131 . B1.1.4 Optional signaling AXI4-Lite supports multiple outstanding transactions, but a slave can restrict this by the appropriate use of the handshake signals. AXI4-Lite does not support AXI IDs. This means all transactions must be in order, and all accesses use a single fixed ID value. Note Optionally, an AXI4-Lite slave can support AXI ID signals, so that it can be connected to a full AXI interface without modification. See Interoperability on page B1-128 . AXI4-Lite does not support data interleaving, the burst length is defined as 1. ----- B1.2 Interoperability This section describes the interoperability of AXI and AXI4-Lite masters and slaves. Table B1-2 shows the possible combinations of interface, and indicates that the only case requiring special consideration is an AXI master connecting to an AXI4-Lite slave. Table B1-2 Full AXI and AXI4-Lite interoperability Master Slave Interoperability AXI AXI Fully operational. AXI AXI4-Lite AXI ID reflection is required. Conversion might be required. AXI4-Lite AXI Fully operational. AXI4-Lite AXI4-Lite Fully operational. B1.2.1 Bridge requirements of AXI4-Lite slaves As Table B1-2 shows, the only interoperability case that requires special consideration is the connection of an AXI4-Lite slave interface to a full AXI master interface. This connection requires AXI ID reflection. The AXI4-Lite slave must return the AXI ID associated with the address of a transaction with the read data or write response for that transaction. This is required because the master requires the returning ID to correctly identify the transaction response. If an implementation cannot ensure that the AXI master interface only generates transactions in the AXI4-Lite subset, then some form of adaptation is required. See Conversion, protection, and detection on page B1-131 . B1.2.2 Direct connection requirements of AXI4-Lite slaves An AXI4-Lite slave can be designed to include ID reflection logic. This means the slave can be used directly on a full AXI connection, without a bridge function, in a system that guarantees that the slave is accessed only by transactions that comply with the AXI4-Lite subset. Note This specification recommends that the ID reflection logic uses AWID, instead of WID, to ensure compatibility with both AXI3 and AXI4. ----- B1.3 Defined conversion mechanism This section defines the requirements to convert any legal AXI transaction for use on an AXI4-Lite component. Conversion, protection, and detection on page B1-131 discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches that can be used. B1.3.1 Conversion rules Conversion requires that the AXI data width is equal to or greater than the AXI4-Lite data width. If this is not the case then the AXI data width must first be converted to the AXI4-Lite data width. Note AXI4-Lite does not support EXOKAY responses, so the conversion rules do not consider this response. The rules for conversion from a full AXI interface are as follows: - If a transaction has a burst length greater than 1 then the burst is broken into multiple transactions of burst length 1. The number of transactions that are created depends on the burst length of the original transaction. - When generating the address for subsequent beats of a burst, the conversion of bursts with a length greater than 1 must take into consideration the burst type. An unaligned start address must be incremented and aligned for subsequent beats of an INCR or WRAP burst. For a FIXED burst the same address is used for all beats. - Where a write burst with length greater than 1 is converted into multiple write transactions, the component responsible for the conversion must combine the responses for all of the generated transactions, to produce a single response for the original burst. Any error response is sticky. That is, an error response received for any of the generated transactions is retained, and the single combined response indicates an error. If both a SLVERR and a DECERR are received then the first response received is the one that is used for the combined response. - A transaction that is wider than the destination AXI4-Lite interface is broken into multiple transactions of the same width as the AXI4-Lite interface. For transactions with an unaligned start address, the breaking up of the burst occurs on boundaries that are aligned to the width of the AXI4-Lite interface. - Where a\\n Relevance Specs from the chunk:\\n 1.
