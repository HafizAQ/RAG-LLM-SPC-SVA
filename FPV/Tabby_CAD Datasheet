=> Open Source Projects maintained by YosysHQ members 

1) Yosys(https://www.yosyshq.com/open-source#h.4axh1nbrg79g): 
Yosys is a framework for RTL synthesis and more. 
It currently has extensive Verilog-2005 support and provides a basic set of synthesis algorithms for various application domains. 
Yosys is the core component of most of our implementation and verification flows.

The version of Yosys that is included in Tabby CAD Suite also includes industrial-strength SystemVerilog and VHDL front-ends.

2) SBY(https://www.yosyshq.com/open-source#h.65xdr0xsveqo): 
SymbiYosys (SBY) is a  front-end for Yosys-based formal verification flows with support for

i) Unbounded and bounded verification of safety properties

ii) Unbounded verification of liveness properties

iii) Reachability check and bounds-detection for cover properties

iv) Additional attributes for management of unconstrained signals

v) Synchronous, asynchronous, and multi-clock designs, resets and latches

SymbiYosys integrates with state-of-the-art SMT solvers and HW model checkers
