=> Open Source Projects maintained by YosysHQ members 

1) Yosys(https://www.yosyshq.com/open-source#h.4axh1nbrg79g): 
Yosys is a framework for RTL synthesis and more. 
It currently has extensive Verilog-2005 support and provides a basic set of synthesis algorithms for various application domains. 
Yosys is the core component of most of our implementation and verification flows.

The version of Yosys that is included in Tabby CAD Suite also includes industrial-strength SystemVerilog and VHDL front-ends.

2) SBY(https://www.yosyshq.com/open-source#h.65xdr0xsveqo): 
SymbiYosys (SBY) is a  front-end for Yosys-based formal verification flows with support for

i) Unbounded and bounded verification of safety properties

ii) Unbounded verification of liveness properties

iii) Reachability check and bounds-detection for cover properties

iv) Additional attributes for management of unconstrained signals

v) Synchronous, asynchronous, and multi-clock designs, resets and latches

SymbiYosys integrates with state-of-the-art SMT solvers and HW model checkers

3) MCY (https://www.yosyshq.com/open-source#h.7lvtcin406jm): 
MCY is a new tool to help digital designers and project managers understand and improve testbench coverage.

4) Amaranth (https://www.yosyshq.com/open-source#h.48dond6xmkys): 
A refreshed Python toolbox for building complex digital hardware.

5) Nextpnr (https://www.yosyshq.com/open-source#h.qtav5ra5lhfo): 
Nextpnr aims to be a vendor-neutral, timing-driven, FOSS FPGA place and route tool.

6) IceStorm (https://www.yosyshq.com/open-source#h.o8frq2qlystu):
Project IceStorm aims to document the bitstream format of Lattice iCE40 FPGAs and provide simple tools for analyzing and creating bitstream files. 

7) Project Trellis (https://www.yosyshq.com/open-source#h.tki6bjudv9a5):
Project Trellis enables a fully open-source flow for ECP5 FPGAs using Yosys for Verilog synthesis and nextpnr for place and route. 

8) PicoRV32 (https://www.yosyshq.com/open-source#h.lhlmi7jk5vtk)
PicoRV32 is a CPU core that implements the RISC-V RV32IMC Instruction Set. It can be configured as RV32E, RV32I, RV32IC, RV32IM, or RV32IMC core, 
and optionally contains a built-in interrupt controller.

9) PicoRV32 (https://www.yosyshq.com/open-source#h.lhlmi7jk5vtk)
PicoRV32 is a CPU core that implements the RISC-V RV32IMC Instruction Set.

10) riscv-formal (https://www.yosyshq.com/open-source#h.bhivb3bfiryc)
riscv-formal is a framework for formal verification of RISC-V processors.
