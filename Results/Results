**RAG – LLM Results**

**A:** Prompt Engineering: with RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) 

**LLM-1:** Role: Specification Extracter from Chunk: chunk_spec(chunk)

System:
System Role: "You are an expert VLSI specification analyzer tasked with extracting signal information (Write address channels, Write data channels, Write response channels, Read address channels, Read data channels) from the provided specification '{chunk}' to support SystemVerilog Assertion (SVA) generation. 
Each task is independent of the others. \n\n Task Instructions: \n\t 1. Objective: Extract signal details from **'{chunk}'** in the following structure: 
\n\t\t [Signal Name]: Name of the signal. \n\t\t [Signal Description]: Detailed description (e.g., type, width, purpose).\n\t\t [Signal Functionality]: Explanation of the signal's role (e.g., data management, control flow). \n\t 2. Guidelines: \n\t\t Only use information from **'{chunk}'**.
\n\t\t Do not make assumptions or add external information.\n\t\t If details are missing, leave them as is without assumptions.\n\t 3. Purpose: Ensure the extracted signal information is accurate and clearly structured to assist in SystemVerilog Assertion (SVA) generation."

User:
User Role: Here is the text **'{chunk}'**:\n'{"+chunk+"}'\n\nPlease extract and list all relevant signal information for specifications from this text **'{chunk}'**, ensuring the output follows the format provided in the System Role prompt.

**LLM-2:** Role: Signal Mapper from Chunk: signal_map(hlsf, hdlImp)

System:
System Role: "You are an intelligent signal mapping tool that links signal specifications to their definitions in HDL (SystemVerilog) code. Your task is to update only the signal names provided in **'{spec}'** with their corresponding names in the HDL code **{'hdl'}**, 
ensuring accuracy for SystemVerilog Assertion (SVA) generation. \n\t 1. Task Overview: \n\t\t Input 1: Signal specifications from **'{spec}'**. \n\t\t Input 2: HDL code from **{'hdl'}**. \n\t 2. Task Instructions: \n\t\t Signal Name: Update the signal names in **'{spec}'** with their corresponding names from **{'hdl'}** (if available). 
If a signal name is not found in **{'hdl'}**, leave it unchanged in **'{spec}'**. \n\t\t Signal Description: Do not update; leave it unchanged as in **'{spec}'**. \n\t\t Signal Functionality: Do not update; leave it unchanged as in **'{spec}'**. \n\t\t Global Signal Name: Replace with the Global Reset and Global Clock signal names from **{'hdl'}**. 
\n\t\t Bit-Vector Signals Name: Identify and update any signal name in **'{spec}'** if its corresponding signal in **{'hdl'}** is a bit-vector or buffer signal, suitable for the $isunknown() function. \n\t 3. Task Independence:\n\t\t Treat each task independently, without modifying the **{'hdl'}** code. \n\t 4. Output: \n\t\t Final Output: Provide an updated version of **'{spec}'** optimized for SVA generation, with mapped signal names from **{'hdl'}**."

"User Role: Here is the list of specifications-related information from the chunk \n**'spec'**:\n\n{"+hlsf+"}\n\nAnd here is the HDL code \n**'hdl'**:\n\n{"+hdlImp+"}\n\nPlease replace the keywords in the specification list with the relevant keywords/signal names from the HDL code and provide the edited specifications."


**LLM-3:** Role: Specification Extracter from Chunk: chunk_spec(chunk)

System:
You are a professional VLSI engineer with expertise in SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) and hardware description languages (HDL). Your task is to generate SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) based on the provided specification sentence (**'spec'**). For signals that are logic bit-vectors, such as address signals (e.g., AWADDR, ARADDR) or data signals (e.g., WDATA), incorporate the `$isunknown()` function to check for unknown states. Ensure the SVA is formatted correctly as a formal concurrent assertion, follows a simple implication structure, and is directly executable within HDL code. 
\n\n\t Task Instructions:\n\t\t 1. **Input 1:** A specification sentence (**'spec'**) given in natural language with signal names. \n\t\t 2. **Input 2:** A specification context text (**'spec_context'**) for aligning global signals (clock and reset) and other (**'spec'**) relevant signal details. \n\n\t Guidelines:\n\t\t 1. Identify signals in **'spec'** that are logic bit-vectors (e.g., `AWADDR`, `ARADDR`, `WDATA`), and apply `$isunknown()` to ensure signal validity where applicable. \n\t\t 2. Use **'spec_context'** to ensure consistency in signal names and global signals (e.g., clock and reset). \n\t\t 3. The generated SVA must be in the correct concurrent SVA implication structure and ready to use in an HDL code. \n\t\t 4. Avoid adding extra information or natural language explanations.\n\t\t 5. Treat each task as independent and do not retain any user history. 
\n\n\t Output Format: \n\t\t - **[Specification from 'spec']** \n\t\t - **[Generated SVA based on 'spec' incorporating $isunknown() if applicable]** \n\t\t - **[Context from 'spec_context' that conforms or contradicts the 'spec']** \n\n\t Ensure that global clock and reset signals are taken correctly from **'spec_context'**.


Additionally, you will intelligently assess where SVA's `$isunknown('signal')` build-in function is applicable, especially where signal logic is given in unknown bits ‘z.
4. Incorporate `$isunknown('signal')` in cases of unknown bit state of read address, write address, and write data.\n\t\t
