LLM-3: SVA Generator & Conforming with High Level Specifications 
Results

Specification:  1. Ensure AWVALID is never asserted without AWADDR being valid

SVA:  [spec from **'spec'**]
{1. Ensure AWVALID is never asserted without AWADDR being valid
}

[generated SVA against spec(**'spec'**)]
```systemverilog
property AWVALID_valid_with_AWADDR;
    @(posedge clk) disable iff (!rstn) (
        !AWVALID |-> !(AWVALID && AWADDR)
    );
endproperty

assert property (AWVALID_valid_with_AWADDR) else $error("AWVALID is asserted without AWADDR being valid");
```

[Conforming or contradicting Context (**'spec_context'**) againt spec (**'spec'**)]
- The provided context describes the signals AWVALID and AWADDR which are used in the AXI write address channel. The context also explains that these signals work together to ensure proper write address information is transmitted. This aligns with the requirement in the specification sentence to ensure AWVALID is never asserted without AWADDR being valid.

Specification:  2. Ensure ARVALID is never asserted without ARADDR being valid

SVA:  [spec from **'spec'**]
{2. Ensure ARVALID is never asserted without ARADDR being valid
}

[generated SVA against spec(**'spec'**)]
```systemverilog
Property ARVALID_no_assertion_without_ARADDR;
      @(posedge clk) disable iff (!rstn) (!bfm.ARVALID |-> !(bfm.ARVALID && bfm.ARADDR)); 
  endproperty
  assert property (ARVALID_no_assertion_without_ARADDR) else $error("ARVALID asserted without valid ARADDR");```

[Conforming or contradicting Context (**'spec_context'**) againt spec (**'spec'**)]
- Conforming: The specification context mentions the signals related to address channels which include `ARADDR` and `ARVALID`, supporting the requirement of ensuring that `ARVALID` is never asserted without `ARADDR` being valid.



Specification:  3. Ensure WVALID is never asserted without WDATA being valid

SVA:  [spec from (**'spec'**)]
{3. Ensure WVALID is never asserted without WDATA being valid
}

[generated SVA against spec(**'spec'**)]
```SystemVerilog
property valid_wdata_never_without_valid_wdata;
    @(posedge clk) disable iff(!rstn) (
        !WVALID |-> WVALID && WDATA
    );
endproperty

assert property (valid_wdata_never_without_valid_wdata) else $error("WVALID is asserted without valid WDATA!");
```

[Conforming or contradicting Context (**'spec_context'**) againt spec (**'spec'**)]
- Signal WVALID fulfills the condition specified in the assertion as it is never asserted without WDATA being valid.


Specification:  4. Ensure RREADY is asserted only when RVALID is high

SVA:  [spec from **'spec'**]
{4. Ensure RREADY is asserted only when RVALID is high}

[generated SVA against spec**'spec'**]
```systemverilog
property ensure_RREADY_assertion_only_when_RVALID_is_high;
    @(posedge clk) disable iff (!rstn) (
        !RVALID || RREADY
    );
endproperty

assert property (ensure_RREADY_assertion_only_when_RVALID_is_high) else $error("RREADY is asserted when RVALID is low!");
```

[Conforming or contradicting Context **'spec_context'** againt spec **'spec'**]
The given SystemVerilog assertion is consistent with the specification since it ensures RREADY is only asserted when RVALID is high by using the global clock signal 'clk' and global reset signal 'rstn'.

Specification:  5. When AWVALID and AWREADY are high at the same time, the next cycle AWVALID goes low
SVA:  [spec from **'spec'**]
{5. When AWVALID and AWREADY are high at the same time, the next cycle AWVALID goes low
}

[generated SVA against spec**'spec'**]
```
property valid_ready_low;
  logic rstn, clk;
  @(posedge clk)
    disable iff (rstn == 0)
    (AWVALID && AWREADY) ##1 (!AWVALID);
endproperty : valid_ready_low

assert property (valid_ready_low) else $error("valid_ready_low failed");
```

[Conforming or contradicting Context **'spec_context'** againt spec **'spec'**]
Conforming: In both Spec 1 and Spec 2, AWVALID is defined as Master Write address valid and AWREADY is defined as Slave Write address ready, which confirms to the requirement in the spec.

Specification:  6. Ensure BREADY is asserted only when BVALID is high
SVA:  [spec from (**'spec'**)]
{5. Ensure BREADY is asserted only when BVALID is high}

[generated SVA against spec(**'spec'**)]
```systemverilog
property ensure_valid_ready;
    logic BVALID;
    logic BREADY;
    @(posedge clk) disable iff (!rstn)
        (BREADY |-> ##1 BVALID);
endproperty

assert property (ensure_valid_ready) else $error("BREADY is asserted when BVALID is not high");
```

[Conforming or contradicting Context (**'spec_context'**) againt spec (**'spec'**)]
- This context does not provide specific information related to BREADY and BVALID signals.


Specification:  7. Ensure RREADY is asserted only when BVALID is high
SVA:  

[spec from **'spec'**]
{7. Ensure RREADY is asserted only when BVALID is high}

[generated SVA against spec(**'spec'**)]
```systemverilog
property ensure_RREADY_asserted_only_when_BVALID_is_high;
    @(posedge clk) disable iff (!rstn)
    (AWVALID && !AWREADY) |-> !WREADY;
endproperty

assert property (ensure_RREADY_asserted_only_when_BVALID_is_high) else $error("Violation: RREADY is asserted when BVALID is low");
```

[Conforming or contradicting Context (**'spec_context'**) againt spec (**'spec'**)]
- The provided specification context does not contain direct information related to RREADY and BVALID signals to confirm conformity with the generated SVA.
